    %h2 A message from the creator of Pixie

    %p
      Hi! I'm Daniel X. Moore, the creator of Pixie. Pixie was born out of a
      frustration with existing game creation tools, tools that had too much to install, didn't run
      on Linux, Mac and Windows, and couldn't export to the web.
    %p
      I want a simple and
      powerful toolkit that I can use to create games instantly, and have them be
      available for all to experience just as fast as I can create them.
    %p
      Pixie is still a work in progress, but that's why I need your help. Try out the
      game creation tools and let me know what you think. The Pixie team and I are
      working hard to make Pixie the best game development platform in the world. It
      is our dream and I hope you can share it with us.
    %p
      I'm glad you stopped by, please
      = link_to "let me know if you have any questions or comments", "/survey", :target => "_blank"
      regarding anything at all.
      I'll try to get back to you as soon as I can.
    %p
      Have fun, and I hope you enjoy Pixie!
    %p.source &mdash; Daniel X. Moore
