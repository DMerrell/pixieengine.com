  %h1 Why Pixie?
  %p
    Pixie enables rapid game development by decreasing the amount of time from a thought entering your brain to the time you see it on screen. Avoid waiting for your game to recompile. With live coding and hot swapping, the second you think of a new feature, it is in your game.

  %p
    Pixie tightly integrates a wide range of design tools such as Animations, Tilemaps, and Pixel art with your game code.
