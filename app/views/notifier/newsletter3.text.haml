  We've added cool new email features to keep you up to date with the ever growing Pixie community. Now you receive emails when people remix your sprites or reply to a forum thread you are interested in. These emails are enabled by default but you can always change your settings by clicking #{edit_user_url(@user, link_tracking)} on your home page.

  The tutorial for this week is a four parter. It teaches you, step by step, how to move an object around and make it jump like in a Mario game. #{ide_project_url(tutorial_1, link_tracking)}, #{ide_project_url(tutorial_2, link_tracking)}, #{ide_project_url(tutorial_3, link_tracking)}, and #{ide_project_url(tutorial_4, link_tracking)}.

  Drop by the #{forem_url(nil, link_tracking)}, ask the tough questions, and learn how to make the game of your dreams. Make sure to introduce yourself to our newest forum members: #{user_list.to_sentence}

  In other news, Ludum Dare 21 happened this past weekend. Ludum Dare is a 48 hour themed game competition. Our own Daniel X. Moore built his entry using Pixie. Check out his FBI surf escape simulator, #{fullscreen_project_url(sur5n, link_tracking)}.

  Thatâ€™s all for now. Now get out there and make those games!
